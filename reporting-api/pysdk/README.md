Before you begin, you must have the API Credentials, which is a combination of Client ID and Secret Key, for the application or tool which you intend to integrate with the Druva products. API Credentials can be created from the Druva Cloud Platform Console.

If you do not have the API Credentials, you can request your Druva Cloud administrator to provide you the API Credentials. Refer to Integration Workflow for the steps.
Sample API Credentials:

    Client ID
    McNkxxxx4Vicxxxx4Ldpxxxx/09Uxxxx

    Secret Key
    Xmcxxxx8j5xxxx6NxxxxRbRxxxxNNyPt
